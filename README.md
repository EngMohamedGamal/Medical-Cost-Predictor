Medical Cost Predictor: Using Linear Regression To Estimate Medical Cost For Insurance Providers.

The global health insurance market size was valued at USD 1,966.6 billion in 2020 and will grow from USD 2,088.5 billion in 2021 to USD 3,038.6 billion in 2028, itâ€™s one of the biggest markets to exist.
Predicting the medical expenses of potential clients can aid insurance providers, policymakers, and individuals in making knowledgeable decisions. Medical costs can have a large impact on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Understanding the factors driving these costs is important for effective financial planning and resource planning.
Prediction algorithms like ours can greatly help insurance providers predict the probable medical cost for a client that they will have to oblige, using a set of factors like the number of children in the household, the age of the client, or their bmi (body mass index). The insights gained from this analysis can help with providing personalized insurance plans, informed risk assessment, and efficient resource allocation in the healthcare sector.

Our prediction algorithm uses linear regression, to figure out the correlation between each factor like (gender, region, age) to figure out the probable medical cost for the client.
We adjusted our prediction algorithm model to provide high accuracy by the usage of a medical cost forecast dataset with over 1,300 different inputs of the age, gender, bmi, smoking status, the number of children, the region and of course the medical charges to reach an accurate prediction.
The findings from this study have the potential to contribute to personalized healthcare planning, knowledgeable decision-making by insurance providers, and improved cost-control strategies within the healthcare industry.
